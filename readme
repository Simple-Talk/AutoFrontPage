This is a simple project to make the front page of Database Weekly site more interesting without extra manpower.
The aim is to construct an interesting page with the latest relevant articles, blogs and  so on.
It would  take an OPML file and use it to gather the latest blogs and articles from a number of RSS/Atom sources. Each source will have its’ own settings in the OPML file to control the special treatment of a site, such as search strings, formatting, search interval, method of getting a description, or  selection of favourite authors.
Each source item is searched  regularly for relevant information using a regex. If relevant, it is added to a list.  This list is used to populate a front page for http://www.databaseweekly.com/  and can then be used to supply interesting links selected by the editors for the DBW newsletter.
It should be possible to colour-code articles by source, so SQL Server Central articles might have a blue band at the top, whereas Simple-talk SQL articles might be charcoal. 
The OPML file would be easily editable so that the editors would then be able to fine-tune the selection and display process.
