      <title>How to optimize performance of distinct count measure group in SSAS?</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104865/how-to-optimize-performance-of-distinct-count-meas.html</link>
      <description>Ok so recently I created a separate measure group within my SSAS project in order to derive the distinct count of various IP addresses that various customers are hitting. 

So my dimension of IP (DimIP) has nothing but the user_Session_IDs and IP addresses of each customer. But there is a many to many relationship between the customer and their IPs. So I created this separate measure group which will give me a distinct count of the IP column for each customer and it will vary by month. 

So after creating this measure group and processing my cube, I have noticed that whenever I try to add it to the browser to build a query, it is very slow because of the various dimensions and calculations it has to do. 

So my question is how can I better optimize this type of measure group? I know for a fact that distinct counts are an expensive operation in SSAS but if anybody can provide me with a solution to speed it up just a little that would really be appreciated!</description>

      <title>Table - increase in columns or rows ?</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104863/table-increase-in-columns-or-rows-.html</link>
      <description>I have to design a table, in which I have to store certain input types and corresponding values for it. Let's say, type of application and the count for it. Earlier, we were using only two fields, and insert a row for each application type. The growth of the table in this case was almost 9000 records per day. Now I am changing the design to have the types as columns, and then insert only 1/9th of the records on a daily base. My question is, will there be an advantage in doing so?</description>

      <title>PASS Summit 2013</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104836/pass-summit-2013-1.html</link>
      <description>Hello Everyone!

I've recently heard about a SQL event called PASS Summit 2013.  I started working with SQL at 18 (currently 20 years old) as an ETL assistant. I love this field of work and would like to continue my learning.  So far, I've mostly learned from experience and from ETL Specialists that I work(ed) with. SQL and SSIS are tricky programs to learn and obviously require time and experience to get good with. Now, back to SQL Summit 2013.  Based on what I've read, this sounds like a HUGE event full of learning experience.  I wanted to get some opinions from people who have attended these Summits in the past:

 1. Is this event designed for Pro DBA's, or is it beginner’s friendly?
 2. What is the typical age group that attends these events (Would love to meet other college students)?
 3. What should I expect if I decide to invest to attend this event? (Session sizes, Quality of Speakers, Learning Friendly averments)
 4. What are the Pros and Cons of **YOUR** SQL Summit experience.

I am only curious to know because I want to be a good stuart of my money and since I am a college, I don’t have extra cash laying around!

Thank You!</description>

      <title>Does loading the data actually affect the ssrs connections</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104831/does-loading-the-data-actually-affect-the-ssrs-con.html</link>
      <description>We load the data every month into the database and process the cubes. This data gets updated in bunch of reports and dashboards hosted on a sharepoint website. Recently the connnections to the reports and dashboards were disconnected when we looked at the website. Does the dataload actually affect the ssrs connections on the website?

Could someone please shed some light on it.

Thanks in Advance.</description>

      <title>Cluster Issue SQL 2005</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104822/cluster-issue-sql-2005.html</link>
      <description>Hi,
We have a Active/Passive cluster set up with 7 instances of  SQL 2005 SP4 Enterprise(64 bit).
Daily at 2 AM the SQL Cluster group is restarting on same node or failing over to the otehr node with errors starting with:

SQL Server has encountered 1 occurrence(s) of I/O requests taking longer than 15 seconds to complete on file  in database.  The OS file handle is 0x0000000000000B98.  The offset of the latest long I/O is: 0x000012b0dfe000

/*there are many occurences of the above message on many instances and particularly msdb database*/

Event Id 4156 MSDTC - String message: ProcId = 0x2188 CSO: Maintain session; Received E_CM_SERVER_NOT_READY. 

Event ID 19019
[sqsrvres] CheckQueryProcessorAlive: sqlexecdirect failed

[sqsrvres] printODBCError: sqlstate = 08S01; native error = 79; message = [Microsoft][SQL Native Client]TCP Provider: The semaphore timeout period has expired.

[sqsrvres] printODBCError: sqlstate = 08S01; native error = 79; message = [Microsoft][SQL Native Client]Communication link failure

[sqsrvres] OnlineThread: QP is not online.

[sqsrvres] CheckQueryProcessorAlive: sqlexecdirect failed

[sqsrvres] printODBCError: sqlstate = 08S01; native error = 0; message = [Microsoft][SQL Native Client]Communication link failure

Above errors are logged in the system logs and all the sql cluster groups are either restarting or failing over to other node every day around 2AM.

Is this due to malfunctioning storage (or) memory bottleneck.
I have collected the performance counters and found that Page life expectancy to a value of "10" at this time with sudden increase in Buffer Manager :Pages/sec to a value of "14500",page IO Latch waits "15",%page file usage "90".
Please tell me how i can troubleshoot this issue.</description>

      <title>Different between Excel and CSV</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104814/different-between-excel-and-csv.html</link>
      <description>Hi,

With Windows 2003 and SQL 2005 SSIS, I try export data to Excel file with multi sheet. It seems the file is not overwritten but append the bottom of each sheet. I cannot delete exisitng file before exporting since SSIS checks sheet;s name. Try to use CSV instead, it has 'delete exiting file' option but seems no way, like Excel' to write different sheet. Is there way to delete existing rows from Excel or csv with multi sheet? Thanks.

      <title>Snapshot replication synchronization</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104813/snapshot-replication-synchronization.html</link>
      <description>Hi,
I have configured snapshot replication with the following configuration

1)	Snapshot agent runs  daily at 4 pm 

2)	And distribution agent is set to running continuously and set to start with SQL Server agent. 

Now, my    question is how the snapshot will applied  to the subscriber?  Is it like when the snapshot is available to the distribution (after 4 pm ,after the snapshot agent job completion  ) .The distribution agent will  automatically pick the snapshot and apply to the subscriber  or Do we have to manually apply the snapshot to the subscriber?  
Please help me understand the process.

      <title>directory gets created twice</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104809/directory-gets-created-twice.html</link>
      <description>I am trying to create a directory with year-month-day
so I defined a variable dir(value `C:\TESTFOLDER`) and evaluated to the expression

    @[User::dir] + "\\"+ (DT_WSTR,4)YEAR(GETDATE()) + "-" + RIGHT("0" + (DT_WSTR,2)MONTH(GETDATE()), 2) + "-" + RIGHT("0" + (DT_WSTR,2)DAY(GETDATE()), 2)

when I execute it creates `C:\TESTFOLDER\2013-07-25\2013-07-25`

I cannot understand why it is getting created twice any ideas greatly appreciated

Thanks a lot</description>

      <title>The 'OraOLEDB.Oracle.1' provider is not registered on the local machine</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104801/the-oraoledboracle1-provider-is-not-registered-on.html</link>
      <description>I have a SSIS (2005) package which was developed on a 32 bit machine. The Package connects to the oracle database and have 2 connections (1 using the MS provider for Oracle and other being Oracle Provider for Oracle).

This works fine on my machine but when deployed on Production server which is a 64-bit machine and executed through a SQL server agent job it gives an error "The 'OraOLEDB.Oracle.1' provider is not registered on the local machine".

I have also installed 32 bit oracle client on this machine.

      <title>SSRS How do I divide column group totals of two matrices that use different datasets?</title>
      <link>http://ask.sqlservercentral.com/questions/104798/ssrs-how-do-i-divide-column-group-totals-of-two-ma.html</link>
      <description>I have an SSRS Report that has two matrices with a different dataset in each matrix.  I have a total column in each matrix.   I want to perform a calculation on the values in the totals columns.

Here is what I want to do:

MatrixA.TotalColumn.Value divided by MatrixB.TotalColumn.Value

So I want to see a column of values showing the calculation between the two.

MatrixA uses a different dataset than MatrixB.
Both MatrixA and MatrixB have the same number of rows and columns.  
There is a total column on the column group for each matrices.  I want to see a column of values of the division of the total columns.</description>
